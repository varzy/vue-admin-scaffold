## FAQ

**Q: Why was it born**

When I built up a new backstage management system, I always had to paste various configurations from the notes, or copy the public part from the previous project. It's annoying to stick too much of them.So I hope to build such an "all-in-one" project, which could be as large as possible to take into accounts the various needs generated in the backstage management system.

**Q: What is the difference with other backstage management system scaffold?**

To be precise, it is not intended to create a "out of the box" management system, but a collection of highlights I found in the process of building a backstage management system. Most of the functions in it have not been rigorously tested, and may just be "best practices in my opinion". The old code could be replaced at any time when I found a better solution.

In summary, I can not guarantee the stability of this project at all.

In addition, even it is a very formulaic backstage system, there will be a drastic difference when corresponded to various needs. So I always don't like to use ready-made templates to revise directly.

**Q: How to use?**

It is strongly not recommended that you clone the project and change it directly. If you're interested in certain features, just take the code you need.
